  - ```-i```: This argument takes the path of the directory containing the sessions to be rated.
  - ```-o```: This argument takes the path of the output directory where the CTRS scores of the sessions will be stored.
  - ```-m_iter```: Number of times GPT-4o is run to score a particular criteria for a session. For multiple runs the average score is noted.
